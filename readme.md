## About xComm

xComm is a simple  demo app created for the CCSE 2018 Hackathon @ KSU. xComm makes transferring money between different money services easier by consolidating data between multiple services. A user can create an account and preform:

- Add Funds to an account from a Service(Bank, Credit, Prepaid, from popular apps like cashApp and Venmo)
- Add multiple Services for one account
- Transfer funds from one service to another
- Transfer funds from Total account Balance to xComm Prepaid Solution.

The xComm Prepaid Solution is a virtual credit card with a Number, Date, and Pin that can be used for all major transactions as well as ACH bank transfers etc.
A Users Account will have an associated xComm Card that holds the Total Balance from within an account(the sum of each service's funds). The Total Balance is not taken from the user's services, it is merely held as an integer value that could be the amount to go onto the card
A User can then perform:

- Buy products online or through third-party retailers
- Transfer Funds from xComm Card to service for that Account
- Transfer Funds from Service to xComm Card for Usage
